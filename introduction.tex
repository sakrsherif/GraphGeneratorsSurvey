\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

In recent years the term Big Data has become a phenomenon that breaks down borders of many technologies and approaches that have so far been acknowledged as mature and robust for any conceivable application. Gartner Inc.\footnote{\url{http://www.gartner.com/}} describes Big Data as ``\emph{high \textbf{v}olume, high \textbf{v}elocity, and/or high \textbf{v}ariety information assets that require new forms of processing to enable enhanced decision making, insight discovery and process optimization}''.

\paragraph*{Contributions} In this survey we will focus on graph data generators in the context of Big Data and related applications of graph algorithms. The key contributions are as follows:

\paragraph*{Differences with prior surveys}

To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first surveying the broad landscape of graph data generators spanning different Big Data applications and 
targeting diverse computer science subfields. In particular, we cover graph database
generators, graph processing generators, social networks and community detection
generators, Semantic Web data generators, graph
analytics generators, IOT, Telecommunication and graph streaming generators, 
and Machine Learning and Graph Mining generators. A comprehensive study of
graph generators is missing for many of the specific subfields mentioned
above.   

A subset of the graph database
generators, parallel and distributed graph processing generators, along
with a subset of the Semantic Web data generators have been discussed in
\cite{BFHI18} while cross-comparing them with respect to input, output,
supported workload, data model and query language; along with the
distinguished chokepoints. However, the provided classification is
inherently data-driven and not meant to serve the purpose of letting any
researcher or practitioner interested in Big Data be able to choose a
generator based on its functional features, such as the application domain,
the supported operations and the key configuration options. 
Moreover, our work is much broader and targets different communities, beyond database
and graph processing communities. 

Graph generators matching graph patterns used in data mining have been
studied in \cite{Chakrabarti:2006:GML:1132952.1132954},
focusing on mostly occurring patterns, such as power laws, size of graph diameters
and community structure. The considered graph generators are compared in
terms of graph type, degree distributions, exponentiality, diameter and
community effects. We refer the reader to this survey for taxonomies
involving these properties, whereas we provide here a functionality-driven
taxonomy across all the categories of graph generators that we consider.

\paragraph*{Outline} The rest of the text is structured as follows: ...
% In Section~\ref{sec:preliminaries} we provide a brief introduction to graph theory and related terms.
% In Section~\ref{sec:classification} we classify the current Big graph Data applications.
% In Section~\ref{sec:generators} we introduce the existing graph data generators in the context of the proposed categories and their main features.
% Section~\ref{sec:comparison} provides comparison of the described generators.
% In Section~\ref{sec:challenges} we discuss challenges and open problems. And in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} we conclude.
